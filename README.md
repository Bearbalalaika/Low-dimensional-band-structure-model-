# Low-dimensional band structure model 
This repo contains band structure modeling tools for III-V compounds, the code based on 4-band approximation k.p theory.

The code was used for the design and modeling of III-V nanostructures, in particular, GaAs/AlGaAs nanostructures in inverted pyramids.

The core code part was developed by Prof. Fredrik Karlsson.

To learn more about band structure models please follow the course presentation slides.
For mode information and examples follow my PhD thesis "PhD thesis Lazarev Mikhail"
